## Theme: Save the planet, what we've learned during the pandemic

KindlyShare is aimed at assisting local neighborhoods in times of crisis.

With the recent lockdowns, every day life has changed dramatically and is not as easy to carry out every day tasks. KindlyShare allows you to connect with your neighbours and put in requests for help, wether it be to borrow a tool or needing groceries due to self isolation.
